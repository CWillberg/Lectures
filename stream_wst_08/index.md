## Real Diagrams
- The diagrams discussed so far are ideal diagrams and do not represent reality.
- The Iron-Carbon Diagram (ICD) is the most important real diagram.
- The base metal is iron, forming steel or cast iron.
- The ICD is composed of ideal diagrams: peritectic, eutectic, and eutectoid sub-diagrams.

---

- Depending on the carbon appearance, we can distinguish between:
  - **Stable system Fe-C**: Carbon exists as graphite.
  - **Metastable system Fe-Fe₃C**: Carbon is bound in Fe₃C (intermediate phase cementite).
- Stable means the carbon in graphite form cannot decompose further, while Fe₃C decomposes into iron and temper carbon upon prolonged annealing.
- The metastable system represents a relative minimum of the system's total energy. For technical purposes, it is considered "sufficiently stable."

---

# Iron-Carbon Diagram (ICD)

- Most important phase diagram.
- Iron is the key material in mechanical engineering.

### Reasons:
- Low cost
- High strength and elastic stiffness
- Variety of possible alloys
- Availability
- Castability, weldability, etc.

# Phase Mixtures / Solid Solution Mixtures

---

## Pearlite (Eutectoid)
- Microstructure of cementite and ferrite (= phase mixture).  
- Forms through the "eutectoid" decomposition of austenite ($\gamma$-solid solution) with 0.8% C at 723°C.  
- Point S: 100% pearlite.  
- Relatively high hardness and strength, low ductility.  

![bg right fit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/c/c8/Perlit.png)

---

- Lamellar structure (layers of $\alpha$-ferrite and Fe₃C crystals).  
- Categorized into coarse, fine, and very fine pearlite based on lamellar spacing.  

![bg right](../assets/Figures/perilitisches_gefuege.png)

---

## Ledeburite

- Microstructure of austenite and cementite or their decomposition products (pearlite and secondary cementite).  
- C content: 4.3%, melting temperature: 1147°C.  
- Point C: 100% ledeburite.  

![bg right](../assets/Figures/ledeburit_gefuege.png)

---

- **Ledeburite I**: Austenite and cementite (above 723°C).  
- **Ledeburite II**: Pearlite, primary cementite, and secondary cementite (at room temperature).  
- Faster cooling may form bainite or martensite instead.  
- Properties: Very low ductility, characteristic "panther skin" pattern.  

---

The properties of the alloy (e.g., steel, cast iron) depend on the involved phases, their relative amounts, and their distribution in the microstructure.  

---

# Phases and Microstructures in Non-Equilibrium States



- Equilibrium states are dominated by diffusion processes.  
- Rapid temperature changes hinder the carbon diffusion required for the segregation of austenite.  
- This leads to the formation of novel microstructural components that deviate from the equilibrium state.  
- Results in "supersaturated" carbon.  

## NOT IN THE PHASE DIAGRAM!

---

## Martensite

- Body-centered tetragonal (BCT) lattice structure ("strained ferritic lattice").  
- Typically features a fine, needle-like, very hard, and brittle microstructure.  
- The carbon, trapped in the BCC lattice of $\alpha$-Fe, distorts and expands the lattice tetragonally through a "diffusionless transformation."  

![bg right 80%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Steel_035_water_quenched.png)


---

- is formed in carbon steels by the rapid cooling (quenching) of the austenite 
- carbon atoms do not have time to diffuse out of the crystal structure in large enough quantities to form cementite (Fe3C).

</div>


---

## Bainite  

- Unlike martensite formation, bainite involves both lattice transformations and diffusion processes.  
- Forms in the temperature range between the pearlite and martensite stages during cooling at rates that are too slow for martensite and too fast for pearlite.  

![bg right 80%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/522OB80Si10_450.jpg)

---

## Bainite Formation  

- Pure bainite can only be achieved through isothermal cooling, such as during austempering.  
- Preferred in cases where quenching and tempering could lead to cracking risks.  
- Offers excellent strength and toughness properties.

## Comparison of Cast Iron Types

---

- **Grey Cast Iron**:  
  - The most common and simplest type of cast iron.  
  - Graphite is present in the form of thin, irregularly shaped lamellae.  
  - The graphite lamellae act as notches under tensile stress, which significantly reduces the tensile strength.  
  - However, it has high compressive strength and excellent damping properties.

![bg right fit](https://www.giessereilexikon.com/uploads/tx_d3ency/189-01.png)

---

- **Grey Cast Iron with Lamellar Graphite**  
  - Ductility and toughness are lower compared to other types of cast iron, but the material exhibits excellent heat conductivity.  
  - It has favorable self-lubricating properties when the graphite is exposed or when other lubricants are used in the cavities of the graphite.

---

### Nodular Cast Iron

- **Nodular (Ductile) Cast Iron**:  
  - This type features graphite in the form of spherical nodules, resulting in superior mechanical properties compared to grey cast iron.  
  - It behaves in a ductile manner and has enhanced tensile strength and toughness.  
  - This form of cast iron is also weldable and can be machined to a high degree.

![bg right 80%](https://matdania.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Nodular_Iron.jpg)

---

### Vermicular Cast Iron

- **Vermicular Cast Iron**:  
  - Has properties between those of grey and nodular cast iron.  
  - Production is more difficult due to the specific requirements for melt treatment and controlled solidification.  
  - Benefits include higher strength and toughness, along with lower thermal expansion.

## General Characteristics of Cast Iron Types:

| Type                   | Characteristics                       | Benefits                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Grey Cast Iron**      | Graphite in lamellar form; brittle    | Good machinability, heat conductivity |
| **Nodular Cast Iron**   | Graphite in spherical nodules; ductile | High tensile strength, impact resistance |
| **Vermicular Cast Iron**| Intermediate properties; controlled graphite structure | Higher toughness, better casting properties |

## Properties of Cast Iron and Steel

| Property               | Cast Iron                            | Steel                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Damping Capacity**    | High                                 | Low                       |
| **Compressive Strength**| High                                 | Moderate                  |
| **Tensile Strength**    | Low                                  | High                      |
| **Thermal Conductivity**| Good                                 | Lower than cast iron       |
| **Machinability**       | Good (in specific forms)             | Excellent in most forms    |
| **Weldability**         | Limited (except in nodular types)    | Excellent                 |

---

### Material Selection

- **Grey Cast Iron** is ideal for applications where damping capacity and castability are important, such as engine blocks and brake rotors.  
- **Nodular Cast Iron** is used where higher mechanical properties and toughness are required, for example in automotive and industrial applications like crankshafts and gear wheels.  
- **Vermicular Cast Iron** is often selected when a balance between strength and castability is necessary, often used in specific automotive and machinery components.

---  

## Stability of Carbon Systems in Iron Alloys

- **Stable Systems**: When the carbon is present in the form of graphite crystals, these systems are more likely to occur under the following conditions:  
  - Higher carbon content.  
  - Higher silicon content.  
  - Slower cooling rates.  
  - These systems typically occur in cast irons.

- **Metastable Systems**: These systems are characterized by cementite (Fe₃C) crystals, where the carbon is not in a free state and is instead chemically bound in the iron lattice.
