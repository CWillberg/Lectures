## Comparison of Materials

- Specific properties

---

Specific properties = $\frac{\text{Property}}{\text{Reference value}}$
Examples:

Specific mass (density) - $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$  
Specific strength - $R_{spec} = \frac{R_{m}}{\rho}$

---

# Non-Ferrous Metals

Steel has an annual production of ~1900 million tons.

---

## Aluminum

Good [overview](https://www.maschinenbau-wissen.de/skript3/werkstofftechnik/aluminium) of properties, manufacturing, etc.

The specific strength of aluminum and steel is very similar.

![bg right 60%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Aluminium-4.jpg)

---

### Advantages:
- Low density, significantly lighter weight compared to similar steel components and structures.
- Aluminum materials can be excellently formed both hot and cold.
- Good castability.
- Hardenable.
- Good machinability.
- Due to a passivating oxide layer on the surface, aluminum materials are generally very corrosion-resistant against numerous aqueous media.

---

### Disadvantages:
- Higher cost compared to steel.

**Applications**:
- Automotive industry
- Aerospace technology
- Bicycles
- Aluminum foil

---

## Production
- Aluminum is obtained from $\text{AL}_2\text{O}_3$.
- The melting point of bauxite is very high, at 2060 °C.
- Hence, smelting electrolysis is used.
- Electrolyte: A solution of aluminum oxide in molten, artificially produced cryolite (a mineral composed of sodium, aluminum, and fluorine).

---

- High energy demand.
- Recycling requires only 5% of the energy needed for primary aluminum production.

[Approximately 60-70 million tons production](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_gr%C3%B6%C3%9Ften_Aluminiumproduzenten)

# Plastics

- Plastics are primarily composed of macromolecules.
- Depending on the manufacturing process and added additives, they have a very wide property spectrum.
- Polymers can be derived from natural substances or fully synthesized.

![bg right fit](../assets/Figures/Syndiotactic_polypropene.png)

---

## Applications
- Packaging industry
- Insulation
- Toys
- Pipes
- Cladding
- Insulation
- Circuit boards
- And more

---

## Environmental Issues

- Over 70% of plastics are stored in landfills, 9% are recycled, and the rest is incinerated.
- Microplastics:
  - Intentionally used (e.g., in toothpaste) or created through mechanical destruction of plastics in the environment.
  - Accumulate in food, animals, and plants.
  - Can have negative effects (not yet proven in humans).

---

## Classification

Thermoplastics:
- Made of non-crosslinked polymers.
- Often have a semi-crystalline structure.
- Can be melted and have a glass transition temperature.
- Recyclable in principle.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Polymerstruktur-teilkristallin.svg)

---

Thermosets:
- Densely crosslinked polymers (crosslinking points shown as red dots).

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Polymerstruktur-engmaschig_vernetzt.svg)

---

Elastomers:
- Loosely crosslinked polymers.
- Loose crosslinking allows for high elongation (e.g., rubber bands).

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Polymerstruktur-weitmaschig_vernetzt.svg)

---

## Glass Transition Temperature

$T_g$ is the temperature at which an amorphous solid (e.g., glass or an amorphous polymer) transitions from a rigid, glass-like state to a soft, rubber-like state.

---

## Thermoplastics
**States of Aggregation**

At different temperatures, thermoplastics take on various states of aggregation, which can be used to shape the material:
- Solid
- Thermoelastic
- Thermoplastic
- Flowable

---

**Common Manufacturing Processes**
- Injection molding
- Extrusion
- Additive manufacturing
- Blow molding
- Film blowing

---

_Applications_
- Automotive industry: Used in interior and exterior cladding, bumpers, and headlight housings.
- Aerospace: Components for airplane and satellite interiors due to low weight.
- Medical technology: Production of disposable syringes, catheters, and other medical consumables.
- Construction: Pipes, insulation materials, and window frames.
- 3D printing

---

Examples:
- Polyethylene (PE)
- Polypropylene (PP)
- Polystyrene (PS)
- Polycarbonate (PC)

---

## Thermosets

- Due to their high degree of crosslinking, thermosets cannot be remelted.
- High temperatures above the decomposition temperature destroy the bonds (pyrolysis).
- Produced through polycondensation.
- Occurs in stages: Intermediate products (oligomers) are stable but still reactive. These oligomers ultimately form macromolecules.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Polykondensation_Bakelit_1.svg)

---

_Applications_

- Brake pads
- Fiber-reinforced composites
- Cable trays
- Car body parts
- Safety helmets

---

Examples:
- Epoxy resins
- Crosslinkable polyurethanes
- Unsaturated polyester resins

---

## Elastomers

- The glass transition temperature is below the application range (becoming glass-like at low temperatures).
- Elastomers can deform elastically and return to their original shape.
- Many elastomers are now synthetically produced. However, there is still a significant market for natural rubber, primarily harvested from the rubber tree. Initial applications also use rubber derived from [dandelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_dandelion).

---

_Applications_
- Sealing rings
- Tires
- Rubber bands

![bg right fit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Polymer_picture.svg)

- Vulcanization influences the number of crosslinks (dots on the right).

---

Examples:
- Natural rubber
- Rubber
- Chloroprene
- Epichlorohydrin

---

**Vulcanization**
Describes the process to transform thermoplastic natural or synthetic rubber into an elastomer:
- Creates covalent bonds (red dots) between molecular chains.
- Sulfur or sulfur-donating substances are used.
- Covalent bonds form as sulfur bridges.
- Aging involves the replacement of sulfur bridges with oxygen bridges.

---

## Additives
Used to modify specific properties of plastics:

- Plasticizers
- Stabilizers
- Pigments
- Fillers
- Reinforcing agents

---

## Glass

- Glass is a frozen state of an undercooled liquid.
- Amorphous structure:
  - Stochastically distributed.
  - Isotropic.
- Glass transition temperature.
- Crystals change their properties abruptly at the melting temperature (phase change).
- This is not the case with glass (no phase change).

![bg 60% right](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Kalk-Natron-Glas_2D.svg)

---

**Properties**
- Vary widely depending on the type of glass.
- Generally very resilient to chemicals.
- Typically brittle (low tensile strength).
- Non-metallic glasses are poor conductors and can be used as insulators.

**Applications**

- Windows
- Containers
- Insulators
- Optics

- The cause of high strength and elasticity lies in the primary covalent bonds between atoms.
- Hence, no dislocation glide like in metals → no plastic properties.
